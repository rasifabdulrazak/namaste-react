Scripts:
==========
-"scripts": {
    "start":"parcel index.html",
  }, this will create a start command for starting our project in dev mode 
-<npm run start> and <npm start> do the same
-we can add this like in the script for build also
-these are keywords reserved by npm
-behind scene it execute parcel as given in package.json file


React Elements:
===================
-its a Js object
-when we render this element to DOM its becomes an html element
-React.CreateElement() => creates an JS object
-when we do ReactDOM.createRoot().render() its make its html

JSX:
=============
-jsx is not part of react
-there is a big diffrence
-we can write react without jsx
-jsx make us easy to write react
-It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. 
We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. 
JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
-its html like syntax or xml like syntax 
-its not a valid javascript (this is not pure javascript), js engine cannot jsx..its only understand ecma scripts
-parcel is doing the job behind the scenes of making js engine undertsand the jsx
-jsx code is transpiled before it reaches to js engine
-transpiling is done by parcel (by package named babel)
-in jsx anywhere we write curly braces ({}) we can write any js code inside it
-jsx takes care of injection attack (it sanitizes the data, prevent cross site scripting)

Babel:(https://babeljs.io/)
============
-its a normal js package
-Babel is transpiling the code
-Babel is a JavaScript compiler.
-it make jsx understand by js engine
-JSX => React.CreateElement() => ReactElement(js object) => HtmlElement(render)
-this conversion is done by Babel
-Babel does a lot off transpilation

React Components :
=====================
-There are 2 type of components (Class based component(old-way), Functional component)
-These are just a normal js function return some jsx or a react element
-Component Composition : component inside another component is called component composotion
-
