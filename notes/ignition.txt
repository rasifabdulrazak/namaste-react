-npx create-react-app give us completely react app ..we can create it our own 
-its diffrent libraries make react faster

npm:
======
-its not node package manager it doesnt have a full form..it manages packages
-its a standard repositry for packages..alll packages are hosted over there
-after init ing npm its gives package.json to our app
======

Bundlers:
==========
-The most important package in our project is a BUNDLER (webpack,parcel,vite,etc..) [Home](https://snipcart.com/blog/javascript-module-bundler)
-we use parcel..it will ignite our app..parcel give strength to our app
-npm install -D parcel (-D indicates dev dependency)
-There are 2 dependencies...Normal and dev dependencies..dev dependecy only needed for development.
-parcel is a beast
- The ^ sign indicates 
  * ~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, will update you to all future patch versions, without incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <1.3.0.
  * ^version “Compatible with version”, will update you to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <2.0.0.
-always safe to put ^ ..which will only install minor versions

package.json and package.lock.json
=====================================
-package.json is configure of npm and all version used
-package.lock.json tells every exact version used and installed

node_modules:
==============
-its contains actual data and its dependency...somany files and folder come becuase every package has its dependencies so it isntalled evertying
-its like a kind of database with all packages

parcel (https://parceljs.org/)
=========
-we will use parcel in this
-parcel has its own dependencies
-there will be a dependensy tree
-we will not put node modules in production or git
-we will put it in gitignore
-we should push package json files to git , becuase it contains all version and modules used
-if we have package json files we can recreate our nodemodules
-npx parcel <filename> :=> runs or execute our server in port 1234
-npx means executing our package
-cdn links is not a good way to build reaact app(changes url when updations, calling another network etc..)
-auto render on refresh is done by parcel
-it created a dev build and server for us
-HMR=>Hot module replacement (parcel track all files)
-it has a file wacthing algorithm (written in C++)
-parcel caches everthything what we do in parcel-cache files
-Parcel do image optimisation
-Minification of file (Bundling)
-compress the files
-consistent hashing
-Diffrential bundlling (To support older browsers)
-Daignostics
-Better error handling
-give https support
-Tree shaking (remove unused codes)

Browserlist (https://browserslist.dev/)
===========
-a helpful tool
